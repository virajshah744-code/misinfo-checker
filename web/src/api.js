/*
 * The API, in one place.
 *
 * The page is rendered by `backend/api/flask_app.py` from the same
 * origin as `/api/*`, so there is nothing to configure and no CORS to
 * arrange. That template also injects `window.__VERILENS__` before this
 * bundle loads — the API base and the limits the server enforces — so
 * the client can refuse an over-long message without a round trip
 * instead of keeping its own copy of numbers that live in Python.
 *
 * Two cases arrive without it: `npm run dev` serves the page from Vite
 * and proxies `/api` to Flask (still same-origin to the browser), and a
 * bundle opened straight off disk has no origin to borrow, so it points
 * at the default dev address. Hence the fallbacks.
 *
 * The one exception is a static host (Vercel) that serves only the
 * bundle: there the API lives elsewhere, so the build is given its
 * origin as VITE_API_ORIGIN, and the server allows it via CORS_ORIGINS.
