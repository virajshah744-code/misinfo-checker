"""
Google Fact Check Tools — the claims that professional fact-checkers have
already published a verdict on.

This is the highest-value retriever in the pipeline, because what it
returns is not an article that might bear on the claim but a *rating* of
a claim, by a publisher, with a date. Most viral Indian forwards are
recycled: the UPI cashback scam, the UNESCO anthem claim and the salt
shortage have each been checked many times, so a single hit here often
settles the question outright.

English and Hindi are queried separately (`languageCode` takes one
locale, and the Indian fact-check corpus is substantially Hindi), and the
results are merged.

No key, no problem: with `GOOGLE_FACTCHECK_KEY` unset the retriever logs
once and returns nothing, and the pipeline runs on its other sources.
