"""
The browser's front door.

`main.py` (FastAPI) is what the bot talks to: it hands over a *path* to
a file it has already saved on the server. A browser cannot do that — it
has bytes in a form — so this app exists to close that gap and to serve
the frontend itself:

    python -m backend.api.flask_app          # http://127.0.0.1:5000

Serving `frontend/index.html` from the same origin as `/api/*` is the
reason there is no CORS configuration anywhere in this file. The page
and the API are one origin, so the browser never preflights.

Everything below is a thin shell. The endpoints validate the request,
save an upload if there is one, call the same `backend.pipeline`
functions the FastAPI app calls, and shape the result with the same
`shape.respond`. No checking logic lives here, and none should: if the
two front doors ever disagree about a verdict, that is a bug in one of
these shells, not a difference of opinion.

Failures inside the pipeline are not HTTP failures. A dead retriever or
a missing model produces `unverified` with an explanation, which is a
useful answer; only a genuinely unreadable request is a 4xx.
